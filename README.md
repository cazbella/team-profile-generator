## Description
The Team Profile Generator is a command-line application that allows users to generate a simple HTML webpage displaying their team's information. The application prompts the user to enter details for various team members, including managers, engineers, and interns. It then generates an HTML file that visually represents the team hierarchy and individual profiles for each team member.

The generated HTML includes cards for each team member, providing essential information such as their name, role, ID, email, and role-specific details (e.g., office number for managers, GitHub username for engineers, and school for interns). The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to efficiently create and showcase their team's details.

## Installation

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Once the installation is complete, you're ready to use the application. Simply run the tool using the command node index.js and follow the prompts to generate a the team cards. Any further customisation of the cards should take place in the generated HTML file.
